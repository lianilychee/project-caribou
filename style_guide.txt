Git Style
1.       The master branch is only for consistently working, polished complete code.
2.       We will be mostly building off the dev branch which contains decent code which generally works and can be build off of.
3.       Our individual work will be built on feature branches off of the dev branch.
4.       Always build on feature branches.
5.       Feature branches begin with an underscore and words are separated by underscores like _line_follow.
6.       Submit a pull request when merging a branch and let another member of the team OK it.

Code Style
1.       Tabs in our project are 2 spaces â€“ not 4 spaces, not tabs, 2 spaces
2.       Code should be a maximum of 80 columns wide.
3.       Wrapped code should be indented by 4 spaces. For example, see here.
4.       Function and variable names should be snake case (lowercase words separated with underscores)
5.       In lists and other comma separated data structures, there should always be a space after (and not before) the next item. For example: [1, 2, 3] is good, [1,2,3] is not.

 
Comment Style
1.       Every function should have a doc string written such that there are 3 double quotes on one line, the comment on the next line(s), and 3 double quotes on another new line. See here for example.
